    <h3>
        Climate
    </h3>
    <p3>Costa Rica is located in Central America between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. This puts it deep inside the tropics – about 
        half way between the equator and the Tropic of Cancer. This region is characterized by heat and humidity and by the existence of a
         rainy season and dry season. Rather than the spring, summer, fall, and winter pattern found in more temperate areas.</p3>
    <h3>
        Plant and Animal life.
    </h3>
    <p4>This country is world-renowned for its abundant and diverse exotic Costa Rica wildlife. With over 500,000 species of wild animals, many rare, endangered and endemic, Costa Rica animals are some of the most diverse in the world. From the adorable sloths to playful monkeys, tiny colorful tree frogs to mammoth 16 foot crocodiles; from endangered Jaguars to tiny wild jungle cats; from pre historic iguanas to the rainbow of more than 918 species of tropical birds; from gentle giants like the whale shark and giant sea turtle to tiny but deadly snakes and frogs.

        Animals are the most beautiful when in their natural habitat. So when you visit Costa Rica, we can help you select the destinations where you will get the best chance to spot certain types of wildlife. Watch sea turtles come ashore to lay their eggs in Tortuguero National Park or catch white faced capuchin monkeys trying to steal your snacks in Manuel Antonio. Wake up to the sound of howler monkeys in Guanacaste and the Nicoya Peninsula, watch a lazy sloth taking a nap in Puerto Viejo by the Caribbean Coast or spot the stunning humpback whales in Drake Bay, Osa Peninsula. Why not come and find as many Costa Rica animals as you can on your next Costa Rica vacation.
